# Ultimaker 3D Printers Dashboard
This is a project for the class Application Development (CCC181) of Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (msuiit).

The application connects to FAB LAB Mindanao's suite of Ultimaker printers and shows monitoring information of them. This includes information on which printers are online, what tasks they're doing, and the progress of said task. This serves as a quick and easy way to monitor the status of the printers without having to manually check them one-by-one.

Ultimaker provides similar functionality from their Cura software which mainly serves as a slicing software. However, they don't provide a quick way to monitor all printers on one screen and only shows information about the printer on individual screens .
